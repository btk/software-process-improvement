##Â Control Patterns

- Software Quality and productivity are moving targets!

These patterns helps us where to go;

**Aggregate control model**
- Shooting with a shotgun, chance to hit the target increases.
- Work on alternative solutions to problem to be safe.

**Feedback control model**
- Shooting like a rifle.
- there is a system to be controlled.

### Controller vs Manager

- There are controllers at every level
- Everyone is acting as a controller for a specific task
(Controller might be checking if there is at least 1 test case for a requirement.)

*Case1>* "Failure to observe" what matters
- We do not measure because none of the metrics are good enough or we don't know how to.
- We measure things but don't use the results.

*Case2>* "Failure to compare the observed" with planned
- Control is not possible unless actual output is compared with planned output.

*Case3>* Not taking action to "bring he actual to the planned"

## Quality is Free

- Adding Value:
  - Less maintainance for producer
  - User friendliness for user

*Value Triangle*
    Quality
  /  Value  \
Cost  ___  Time

- Pick any one or two at the expense of others
- By means of process improvement you can improve all together

Costs for tasks performed
- Materials
- Labor hours
- Capital Equioment
- Other expenses

**Value added Activities**
- Design
- Development
- Documentation

**Non Value Added Activities**
- Gold plating
- Moving a product from one place to another, shipping
- Repairing mistakes
- Tests and inspections (?) if you develop the product the best you can you wouldn't need it, so its non-value added.
