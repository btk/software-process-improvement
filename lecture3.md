# Software Development Patterns

- Quality management program needs a lot of time and efford.

**Cosby's Maturity Grid**

- Stage 1: Uncertainty
  * Not sure how quality is helpful or how it can add value
  * Lack of disciplined methods
  * Can't calculate cost of quality
  - "We don't have tools to ensure quality"

- Stage 2: Awakening
  * Trying to do quality and product management at the same time in different branches.
  * Main attention is still delivering the product in time

- Stage 3: Enlightenment
  * Formal quality improvement program.
  * Management understands that time put into quality improvement adds value

- Stage 4: Wisdom
  * When you work on a problem it disappears
  * Change in a constant pace
  * Everyone is involved in defect prevention

- Stage 5: Certainty
  * We know why we don't have quality problems


# SW-CMM Maturity Levels

- Initial
- Repeatable

- Managed (Based on metrics)
- Optimizing

*Weinberg*:
 - No two software organisations are exactly alike
 - No two software organisations are entirely different

## Organizational Competence

##Â Changing Patterns
 - Insiders: Ignorant of much of the culture
 - Outsider: Ignorant of much of what is good for the company

* We need both perspectives while changing the patterns

**Why change?**
- Organizational demands
- Customer demands
- Problem demands

We can use generic models for change;
- ISO 15504
- There are adventages and problems with using a generic model
