# CI

- Management Approach
- Scientific Thinking and Learning

Continous Improvement
- CI becomes a daily work.
- Occurs in every process and every level.
> Ability to move forward and adapting to the gray zone.

Approaching the process;
- *Workshops:* Focus on a process to imrpove as a team. (1-5 days)
- *Value stream Mapping:* see if there is any delays on the problem. (Shows the problem, not the resolution)
- *Action Item List:* Its like 15507, list things to do.
  * We try to find solutions too quickly, that might block us from finding a better solution.

In toyota:
- Learn
- Deeper undertanding
- Improve

Current (know)      Long Term
Condition ========> Vision (Vague)

CoQ: Quanitfy the prbolem (understand current problem)
Performed Assesment: (undertanding current conditiopn)

CMMI / SPICE Practices: Provides long term vision.

**GAPS LEADS US TO IDENTIFY THE TARGET**

We will face with obstacles in the way.

## Difference of the approach

We have
- process guidance
  * PRocess purpuse, outcomes, bases practices, inputs nadn outputs
- Gaps in the base practices.
- target

Instead of focusing outputs, we need to focus on implementing continous improvement *at the leadership level* to drive the evolution of your organisation and the cprocesses you use.

Waterfall;
  requirement
  design
  coding
  testing
  deployment

All stages deliver a document (output)
* Improving outputs doesn't have a direct impact on the final product. **.(0).**
* Meeting the model requirements doesn't mean the final product will be high quality.
* If the output is ineffective, thats a problem too.

Experimental approaches takes longer but
- showing measureable benefits faster
- reducsing the risk of change
- people to learn themselves
- improvement continous after the change agents leave

## KATA
- about daily routines.
- japanese (kata): small movement daily basis will help
- the movements are internalized by the employees

*Experimentations!*

(Clear) Current Condition (**Measureable**)
(Clear) Next Step (**Measureable**)
(NOT Clear) Problem Obstacles
(Clear) Target Condition (**Measureable**)

> Defect rate needs to be decreased 20%

- Rapid cycles
- 1 step at a time
- Mentor/mantee
