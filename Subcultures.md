SEC2: Software Subcultures


In the previous assignment I had similar issues with Cosby’s take on quality being the conformance to the requirements.


“That's an excellent definition as long as requirements are correct”


In the article it argues that defining the right requirements becomes crucial to the end result product/service’s value, since the main goal of ensuring quality is actually extracting the most value we can from the end product.


Another great addition to Cosby in this article is about the economics of quality. Cosby argues that it doesn’t exist, since there is always one totally right requirement set. In the article it rightly notes that when we don’t know what customer values are, it creates a negotiation on the quality hence creating an economy of it.


Addition to customer's values, I think there is a value that we need to balance with hitting the market first for most customer facing software products, which would potentially make more money depending on balancing the requirements mid-project, which invalidates Cosby’s thinking of “It's always cheaper to do it for the first time.


Classification of organisations on degree of congruence;


Oblivious: Not aware of the process

Variable: Follows Oblivious, but when problem solvers are aware of it, there is a separation of the responsibility on assuring quality. There is no way a developer stays oblivious to the project, especially one that takes a long time.

Routine: For a bigger team, variation wouldn’t be very healthy, having a routine involvement of managers are required.

Steering: Generally follow the processes defined beforehand even in crisis times, this subculture adoption makes it a better choice for riskier projects.

Anticipating: Similar to steering managers, but sits at a higher level and anticipates the issues that will occur and acts on them faster.

Congruent: Organisation will understand and follow the procedures and everyone is involved in making it better at all times.


If I would try to determine which subcultural software pattern we are as our organisation, we are a small software company, few developers making mobile apps. I would say we fit more in Variable pattern.

While we are building products, we most of the time notice issues that would create big value lost in terms of user experience, then we consciously go back and find ways to solve these. But we don’t have a clear routine on, and it's usually emitted by a developer, or at a test stage.
