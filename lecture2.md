# Process Improvement

Process: Set of tools and methods.

- ISO 12207 / Software Lifecycle Processes, set of activities that will input => outputs
- Process has an end and beginning.
- Process is dynamic

*Process Model:* The diagram model
*Process Description:* The paragraph based steps of description.

Granulity/Abstraction level of Process
- High granularity: not much information, waterfall lifecycle
- Fine granularity: detailed tasks like taking a backup, spesific tasks in spesific order.

ISO/IEEE 12207: International Process lifecycle standart (158 page pdf)

     ^       | - Process plan/map: What to do
 Increased   | - Methods: How to do it
 Grunality   | - Automation: Doing it efficiently

- Start from the process planning.
- Tools without methods are like a fast car with an inexperienced driver.
- Try to move things from people to processes.

## Process Improvement
- Define: make the processes explicitly
- Redefine:
- Analyze: See if the process is a fit
- Optimize, redesign (define): increase the efficiency

*Software Problems:* Problems in the process and testing creates significant problems.

## Quality

- Conforming with the requirements.
- Quality is measurable by the expense of nonconformance
- Decide on a balanced perspective on the product's quality measurements
- "Quality is free": When you increase the quality, the dev time and price of the product increases.

- **Improving quality through product:** Keep the assembly line going when defects are detected.
  * People finding defects are warned, so they tent to hide the mistakes.
- **Improving quality through process:** Stop the assembly line when you find defects, and optimize the process.
  * People finding defects are rewarded.

## Variation

- Soda factory;
  * Some bottles have more some less liquid in them.
  * Take a sample batch and plot out the variations, (deming cycle) optimise the process.

**Deming Cycle**
- Plan: plan for a change or test it
- Do: Make the change
- Check: Study the results.
- Act: Adopt the change or abandon it, then plan again.

*:* Zero defect in creative areas of software design is not realistic.

Why improving quality is difficult
- People still buy it
- Users like it enough
- All software has bugs anyway
- It is not worth the cost
- Lock-on effect: risk of change, "it works"
- Individuals creating the product always choose the comfort

*:* Defining only can ben done by the person who do the work.
- We shouldn't expect process set to fit to all the projects the company has (hardware intensive vs web app)
- Commitment is important for process adoption.
- Process adoption is normal distribution.
