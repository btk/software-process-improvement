SEC2: Quality May Not Be What You Think It Is


Assumptions about “Quality” makes it hard for us to discuss it, so we need to clear those wrong assumptions first. 


Few of this assumptions can be underlined as;
* Quality is the goodness that always costs more. No, it’s the conformance to requirements. To talk about quality, we first need to define the requirements to give it a definition and measure it.
* Quality is not measurable. No, it is measurable by the cost of nonconformance to the requirements. Cost of quality is the amount of lost monetary value by not assuring quality.
* In some cases, we can’t afford the quality. No, It is always cheaper to do things right for the first time. Economics of quality doesn’t exist, making things that don’t meet the requirements won’t save you money.
* Workers cause all the quality problems. No, looking and finding the most identifiable quality errors in the manufacturing area won’t mean all errors originate there. Should look at the process and identify the root problems.
* Quality is the responsibility of the quality department. No, the quality department is responsible for measuring quality and educating other departments about assuring quality, even though the quality department does its job perfectly, there will still be problems caused by other departments not doing their jobs, which will lead to products that don't meet requirements, aka, has quality problems.


Quality management professions need to be objective and not involve in the creation of the company’s products/services. (Pilot in the aircraft/pilot drives the aircraft remotely analogy)


QM is a systematic way to guarantee the actions of the organizations happen according to plan.


Ascription to the “workers cause all quality problems”; there are ways that might cause individuals at lower levels to deteriorate the process, but effective quality management must start at the top.


Things I would like to discuss
How would we compare the assumption of workers causing problems to the software management process. Maybe saying “looking for bugs in programs are wrong” instead “look for the management process that introduced that bug?” (Workers =? Programs) Or would we say that in this analogy workers are the designers and developers that create the programs, even though they are the creatives?
